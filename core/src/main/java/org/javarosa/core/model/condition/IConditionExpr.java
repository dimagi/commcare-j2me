/**
 * A condition expression is an expression which is evaluated against the current
 * model and produces a value. These objects should keep track of the expression that
 * they evaluate, as well as being able to identify what references will require the
 * condition to be triggered.
 *
 * As a metaphor into an XForm, a Condition expression represents an XPath expression
 * which you can query for a value (in a calculate or relevancy condition, for instance),
 * can tell you what nodes its value will depend on, and optionally what values it "Pivots"
 * around. (IE: if an expression's value is true if a node is > 25, and false otherwise, it
 * has a "Comparison Pivot" around 25).
