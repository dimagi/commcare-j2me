/**
 * A response to a question requesting a selection
 * from a list.
 *
 * This class may exist in 3 states:
 *
 * 1) only index has a value
 * 2) only xmlValue has a value
 * 3) index, xmlValue, and choice have values, where index and xmlValue are simply cached copies of the values in 'choice'
 *
 * the 3rd form is the most full-featured, and is required for situations where you want to recover the captions for the
 * choices, such as form entry. the choice objects used in the form entry model will receive localization updates,
 * allowing you to retrieve the appropriate caption.
 *
 * the 2nd form is useful when dealing with FormInstances without having to worry about the FormDef or the captions
 * from the <select> or <select1> controls. this form contains enough information to convert to an XML instance
 *
 * the 1st form is used when serializing instances in an ultra-compact manner, but requires linking to a FormDef before
 * you can do anything useful with the instance (insufficient info to convert to XML instance).
