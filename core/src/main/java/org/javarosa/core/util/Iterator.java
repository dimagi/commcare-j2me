     * (this is a RuntimeException). To prevent this from happening, you can lock the entire StorageUtility
     * *before* calling iterate(), and release the lock only after you have iterated through all records.
     * However, this will prevent all other threads from access the StorageUtility for the entire duration
     * of the iteration. Also, it will not protect against you modifying the storage in the same thread you
     * are doing the iteration in.
     *
     * Also, if you call nextID(), then call StorageUtility.read() yourself, there is a very slight risk that
     * another thread will change or invalidate the record with that ID in between your call to nextID() and
     * read(). To prevent against that, you can lock the StorageUtility before calling nextID and release it
     * after calling read(). This risk does not exist when calling nextRecord().
