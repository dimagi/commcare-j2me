/**
 * IStorageUtility
 *
 * Implementations of this interface provide persistent records-based storage in which records are stored
 * and retrieved using record IDs.
 *
 * IStorageUtility can be used in two flavors: you manage the IDs, or the utility manages the IDs:
 *
 * If you manage the IDs, the objects you are storing must implement Persistable, which provides the ID from the object
 * itself. You then use the functions read(), write(), and remove() when dealing with storage.
 *
 * If the utility manages the IDs, your objects need only implement Externalizable. You use the functions read(), add(),
 * update(), and remove(). add() will return a new ID for the record, which you then explicitly provide to all subsequent
 * calls to update().
 *
 * These two schemes should not be mixed within the same StorageUtility.
