/**
 * Represents a set of XPath nodes returned from a path or other operation which acts on multiple
 * paths.
 *
 * Current encompasses two states.
 *
 * 1) A nodeset which references between 0 and N nodes which are known about (but, for instance,
 * don't match any predicates or are irrelevant). Some operations cannot be evaluated in this state
 * directly. If more than one node is referenced, it is impossible to return a normal evaluation, for
 * instance.
 *
 * 2) A nodeset which wasn't able to reference into any known model (generally a reference which is
 * written in error). In this state, the size of the nodeset can be evaluated, but the acual reference
 * cannot be returned, since it doesn't have any semantic value.
 *
 * (2) may be a deviation from normal XPath. This should be evaluated in the future.
