/**
 * A periodic event is an action that should be called up automatically
 * according to some sort of schedule. Periodic events are states which
 * can have an arbitrary interaction with the user, although they are
 * expected to only have one exit point.
 *
 * When implementing a PeriodicEvent, your event should specify 3 things at a minimum.
 *
 * 1) Event Period - How often the event can happen. Weekly, daily, or on every login.
 * In addition, if your event should only occur after it has been scheduled explicitly,
 * you should add that flag as a mask. IE: TYPE_DAILY & TYPE_FLAG_SCHEDULED.
 *
 * Scheduled events will occur at the soonest login after they are scheduled and after
 * the last scheduled period. So if a daily event has occurred within the last day, and is
 * scheduled, it will occur on the first login that is a day after the previous event.
 *
 * 2) The action of the event. You can implement this simply as the body of the event's state
 * as you would normally. When your event has finished, remember to trigger the done transition.
 *
 * 3) A unique Event Key that is used as an index for the actual event record. Any unique string
 * is appropriate (fully qualified class name is an entirely reasonable choice).
 *
 * The current method of scheduling events relies upon being able to create an event in a manner
 * distinct from executing that event, so it is advised that an event's constructor be empty and
 * that initialization not be required.
